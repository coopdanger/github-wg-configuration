1.  Introduction

   Many IETF working groups and participants are making use of Github in
   different ways as part of their work on IETF documents.  Some others
   are interested in having their working groups use Github to
   facilitate the development of working group documents, but they are
   unfamiliar with how to get started or they are unclear about which
   conventions to follow.

   This document proposes a set of administrative processes and
   conventions for IETF working groups to use if they chose as a working
   group to use Github to facilitate their work.  The proposals in this
   document are not directed at working groups or individuals that are
   already using Github to do IETF work.  Practices vary among existing
   working groups and some of them are not consistent with the
   conventions proposed here.  That is fine.  The goal of the proposals
   in this document is not to require uniformity in current practice,
   but to help working groups to get started using Github in a uniform
   way if they want to.

   The document is meant to spur discussion in the IETF community.  If
   there proves to be rough consensus in the community in support of the
   proposals in this document, the functional requirements would need to
   be discussed with the IETF tools team and the secretariat who would
   need to support various pieces of what is proposed here.

   Discussion of this document takes place on the GitHub@ietf mailing
   list (ietf-and-github@ietf.org), which is archived at
   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/search?email_list=ietf-and-github.

2.  Administrative Process and Conventions

   This section specifies a proposal for an administrative process and
   conventions to support the creation and management of Github
   organizations for working groups in a uniform way.  The steps could
   be done manually by the secretariat or they could be automated.  See,
   e.g., https://github.com/richsalz/ietf-gh-scripts and
   https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template for work on automation.
   In this document the question of whether these processes would be
   manual or automated is deliberately left ambiguous since the first
   question is whether this is functionality the community would want to
   have supported at all.

   Most of the conventions below are drawn from
   [I-D.thomson-github-bcp].

2.1.  Creation of Github organization

   We propose that there be a facility in the datatracker interface to
   allow an area director or working group chair to request the creation
   of a Github organization for a particular working group.  Ideally,
   this facility would appear both as part of the working group
   chartering UI as well as the working group page UI.

   When an area director or working group chair makes a request to
   create a Github organization, the following process would be
   initiated:

   1.  Create a Github organization for the working group.

   2.  Name the organization as follows: ietf-<wgname>-wg

   3.  Initialize the organization by designating the secretariat and
       the area directors in the working group's area as owners.  If the
       responsible AD for the working group is from another area, that
       AD will be an owner as well.

   4.  Initialize the organization with a team that has administrator
       access.  This team will consist of the working group chairs and
       working group secretary, if one exists.

   Once the organization is created, the URL for the organization would
   be added to the working group's page in the datatracker.

2.2.  Personnel changes

   When there are personnel changes in the area or the working group,
   those changes would be reflected in the Github organization.

2.3.  Working group closing

   When a working group is closed, the team with administrative access
   would be removed and the owner list would be returned to its initial
   composition.  Repositories would be updated to indicate that they are
   no longer under development.

3.  Working group process

   [I-D.thomson-github-bcp] contains discussion of the different
   possible ways that a working group can use Github and the large
   number of decisions associated with doing so.  This section proposes
   a minimal set of administrative policies for working groups to follow
   and the administrative support needed to carry out those policies.

3.1.  Contributions

   At a minimum, every repository created in a working group
   organization would incorporate the boilerplate text [1] from the IETF
   license file for open source repositories into its CONTRIBUTING file.
   The CONTRIBUTING file might contain other information as well (see
   https://github.com/ietf/repo-files/tree/master/contributing-samples
   for examples).

3.2.  Back-up and archival

   [TBD.  Would like to propose a standard way of doing both of these
   things, but really not sure what to suggest.  Best I can come up with
   now:

   For back-up: If we could identify a server endpoint on ietf.org,
   would be nice if we could automatically back up all repos in orgs
   that get created via the datattracker using the mechanism described
   above.

   For archival: Is the dummy-account-send-to-a-separate-mailing-list
   the best we have on this right now?]

4.  Security Considerations
